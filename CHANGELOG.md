## [Unreleased]

### ✨ Runtime Capabilities

- Added structured dialogue request metadata so language preference, speech configuration, and recent vision context travel together with each chat turn
- Persisted speech preferences and recent vision context in `digitalHumanStore`, and localized the voice interaction panel for multi-language TTS flows
- Added custom avatar upload, replacement, fallback-to-built-in handling, and avatar management controls in the settings drawer
- Added endpoint discovery with primary/backup failover for health checks, standard chat requests, and streaming chat requests
- Added touch/WebXR readiness detection and surfaced an `AR Ready` platform indicator in the HUD
- Added immersive WebXR AR session entry/exit flow, persisted immersive session state, and a viewer bridge that forwards the active XR session to the Three.js renderer
- Added operator-facing endpoint routing diagnostics so the HUD now surfaces the active service endpoint and failover count
- Added a shared avatar source adapter so page composition, settings UI, and controller fallback logic reuse the same source/status/object-URL decisions

### 🧹 Repository Simplification

- Removed repository-scoped AI workflow frameworks and generated automation from `.trellis/`, `.claude/`, and `.opencode/`
- Simplified contributor guidance to a minimal `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` surface
- Removed residual AI workflow docs from `docs/agents/` and deleted the repository Copilot instruction file
- Dropped the duplicate root `docs/api/`, `docs/architecture/`, and `docs/guide/` trees in favor of the canonical localized docs
- Removed the legacy `/advanced` and `/digital-human` app aliases so the product runtime has a single `/app` entry
- Removed deprecated module-level dialogue orchestrator wrappers and kept orchestration instance-scoped
- Stopped exposing changelog navigation in the landing page and docs site
- Corrected stale docs and Pages copy that still claimed Docker, Render, CLI scaffolds, templates, and old backend paths
- Consolidated historical notes from the removed `changelog/` directory into this file

### 🗂️ Historical Notes Consolidated From `changelog/`

- **2026-05-22** — Scoped dialogue runtime to the service container, normalized `DigitalHumanEngine` invalid inputs, and tightened broad UI subscriptions
- **2026-05-21** — Removed the dead `DigitalHumanViewer` pass-through export, centralized service adapters, and moved dialogue orchestration away from module-level state
- **2026-05-15** — Removed the deprecated voice command processor and clarified the four-file service container structure
- **2026-05-12** — Consolidated voice command handling into `src/core/voiceCommand/`
- **2026-05-12** — Added automatic language detection and persisted language preference for GitHub Pages

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-29

### 🏗️ Architecture

- **Python Backend** — Moved `server/` to `examples/backend-python/` as optional reference implementation
- **Project Structure** — Clarified backend is optional, frontend is zero-config by default

### 📚 Documentation

- **README** — Added backend optional note, unified Node.js ≥22 requirement
- **docs/guide/** — Removed Python prerequisite, updated project structure
- **docs/index.md** — Fixed version number (v1.0.0 → v2.1.0)
- **changelog/** — Removed duplicate CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md

### 🛠️ Engineering

- **build-pages.sh** — Added sitemap generation, build timestamp, size output
- **.gitignore** — Added `*.tsbuildinfo`, updated Python comments
- **.vscode/** — Added settings.json and mcp.json

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-29

### 🏗️ Architecture Overhaul

#### Observability & Turn Ownership (from p0-foundation-observability)

- **Dialogue Orchestrator** — Introduced `turnId`-based ownership isolation; `finalizeDialogueTurn` only executes cleanup when the current turnId matches, preventing cross-turn state corruption
- **Chat Session Store** — Added local persistence (sessionId + chat history), message limit enforcement (100 max), transient streaming placeholder filtering, and robust deserialization with type guards
- **System Store** — Added `ConnectionDiagnostics` (health check latency, degraded state tracking), `recordConnectionHealth()` action, and factory functions for initial metric state
- **Audio Service** — Fixed optional property assignments for ASR config (non-null assertions for constructor-initialized defaults)
- **Chat Transport** — Fixed TypeScript union type narrowing for `WSServerEvent` after while-loop guard; added `as const` assertions for literal types
- **WS Client** — Removed unused `resolveConnect` field

#### Project Cleanup

- **Removed 20+ dead files**: `.omc/`, `Dockerfile`, `docker/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `render.yaml`, `lighthouserc.json`, `docs/superpowers/`, `docs/portal.html`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, and more
- **Removed 3 worktrees**: `final-terminal-state`, `p0-foundation-observability`, `fix/ci-tests`
- **Removed 4 stale branches**: Only `master` remains
- **Rewrote `.gitignore`**: Clean categorized structure, removed duplicates

#### Documentation

- **AGENTS.md** — Deep rewrite with file change impact matrix, debug decision tree, and prohibited actions checklist
- **CLAUDE.md** — Streamlined for Claude Code-specific workflow; added Zustand 5 and TW4 gotchas
- **copilot-instructions.md** — Reduced to essential quick-reference index
- **README.md / README.zh-CN.md** — Fixed CI badges (main→master), updated version badges (React 19, Vite 6, Three.js 0.177), removed Render deployment section, corrected path alias table (`@/*` → `src/*`)
- **CHANGELOG.md** — Fixed broken migration guide link

#### CI/CD

- **ci.yml** — Replaced hardcoded release body with `generate_release_notes: true`
- **build-pages.sh** — Removed portal.html copy; React LandingPage is now the Pages entry point
- **OpenSpec** — Updated config.yaml tech stack versions; archived p0 change proposal

### 🐛 Fixed

- Fixed 2 test failures caused by `speakWith` becoming fire-and-forget (microtask flush needed before assertion)
- Fixed ESLint errors from unused catch variables in audioService.ts

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-27

### 🔧 Changed

#### Code Quality

- **TypeScript Strict Mode** — Enabled `strict`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`
- Fixed 31 type errors across the codebase
- Removed unused React imports from component files
- Fixed type safety issues in `chatTransport.ts` and `wsClient.ts`

#### Code Deduplication

- Unified `buildEmptyResponse` function between `dialogueService.ts` and `chatTransport.ts`
- Exported `buildEmptyResponse` from `dialogueService.ts` for reuse

### 📚 Documentation

- Unified Node.js version requirement to ≥ 20 across all documentation
- Updated Bundle Size badge to reflect actual gzipped size (~240KB)
- Added `.nvmrc` file for Node.js version management
- Created `server/requirements.lock` for Python dependency pinning
- Enhanced `AGENTS.md` with testing guidelines and refactoring standards
