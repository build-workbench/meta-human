## Quick Links

- [Getting Started](/en/guide/getting-started) - Up and running in 5 minutes
- [Installation Guide](/en/guide/installation) - Detailed setup instructions
- [Configuration](/en/guide/configuration) - Environment variables reference
- [API Documentation](/en/api/overview) - Backend API reference
- [Architecture](/en/architecture/overview) - System design

## Design Principles

1. **Zero-config by default** — Works out of the box with automatic fallback to local mode
2. **Graceful degradation** — External service failures don't break the core experience
3. **Modular architecture** — Avatar, voice, dialogue are independent and replaceable
4. **Minimal re-renders** — Focused state stores prevent unnecessary updates
5. **Browser-first** — Process client-side whenever possible, minimize server dependency
